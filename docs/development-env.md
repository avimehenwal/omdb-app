```
yarn global add expo-cli
expo init AwesomeProject
```

- yarn >> npm, due to workspaces and better/faster dependency management as seen on linux

## React Native

- Since React's Hooks API in 2017, functional components >> class components
- Native components vs Core components (`View`, `Text`)
- Synthetic events are named differently `onChangeText`
- How to handle heterogeneous Scroll? `ScrollView`
- React Native provides the **Fetch API** for your networking needs.

## RN Components

- StatusBar - show/hide status as a part of app
